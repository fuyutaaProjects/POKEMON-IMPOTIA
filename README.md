This repository holds the RPG Maker XP project files for **Pokémon Impôtia**, a fan game built using the Pokémon SDK devkit.

⚠️ **A heads-up about commits:** You might notice commit messages are a bit vague or that large chunks of lines are committed at once. That's just how progression looks when working with RPG Maker XP, you edit a ton of files everytime you work on it. Also, the commit descriptions are vague because it doesn't matter, as I am the only programmer of the team, and I am completly sure that no other programmer will join me.

All game data is unencrypted and openly accessible. However, I kindly ask that you **do not steal my spritesheets, tilesets, or original soundtracks (OSTs)**. These are my private assets.

Feel free to use my custom Ruby scripts if you find them useful! If you use a substantial script, I'd appreciate it if you could give credit.
