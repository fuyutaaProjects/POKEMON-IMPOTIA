This repository holds the RPG Maker XP project files for **Pokémon Impôtia**, a fan game built using the Pokémon SDK devkit.

🌴🌴 This project, **Pokémon Impôtia**, stands as my biggest and most ambitious endeavor to date. Over the course of three years, I had the privilege of leading a dedicated team of seven to create this unique and original fan game. Players can expect **dozens of hours of immersive gameplay** within this adventure. 🌴🌴

The game includes a lot of custom content:
* ✅ **206+ unique character sprites**, each with comprehensive up, left, right, and down animations.
* ✅ **245 original Fakemon**, complete with concept art, sprites, and detailed stats.
* ✅ A **fully original cast of characters**, from Gym Leaders to the Elite Four, crafting a fresh narrative.
* ✅ Over **35 custom dialogue artworks** for in-game Pokémon trainers, adding depth to interactions.
* ✅ **Predominantly original tilesets**, ensuring a unique visual experience with minimal reliance on official game assets.
* ☑️ Around **34 original soundtrack (OST) tracks**, designed to immerse you in the region of Vistoria.
* ☑️ **Hundreds of meticulously crafted maps** that invite exploration.
* ☑️ A collection of **original battle backgrounds** to enhance combat encounters.

⚠️ **A heads-up about commits:** You might notice commit messages are a bit vague or that large chunks of lines are committed at once. That's just how progression looks when working with RPG Maker XP; you edit a ton of files every time you work on it. Also, the commit descriptions are vague because it doesn't matter, as I am the only programmer on the team, and I am completely sure that no other programmer will join me.

All game data is unencrypted and openly accessible. However, I kindly ask that you **do not steal my spritesheets, tilesets, or original soundtracks (OSTs)**. These are my private assets.

Feel free to use my custom Ruby scripts if you find them useful! If you use a substantial script, I'd appreciate it if you could give credit.
